# LogDevice Ops
This is the core operational library for logdevice. This package includes key
abstractions required by the tooling to manage logdevice clusters.

This code is python-3 only!

P.S. This code is open-source only, if you are working on anything that cannot
be open sourced, look somewhere else.
